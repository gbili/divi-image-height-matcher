# Divi Image Height Matcher
When you insert images with different sizes in an html row dif, sometimes you want all of them to have the same height.

What this plugin does is to force the height of all images to be the same, while keeping the aspect ratio.
Height matcher is used in Wordpress Divi.

When inserting more than 1 column in a row, and using the image module in each column: if the images' aspect ratio differs, then _Divi will display both images at **different heights** in order to match a percentage of the true image size_. This plugin corrects this:

## Usage

Install it, and it will automatically apply to divs having the `.et_pb_row` class.

## TODO
Make the class customizable, such that the user can decide to which classes this plugin should apply.
